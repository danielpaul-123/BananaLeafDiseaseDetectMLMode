            <h1>Banana Bract Mosaic Virus (BBrMV) Fact Sheet</h1>

            <br>
            <h2>What is Banana Bract Mosaic Virus?</h2>
            <p>Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV), also known as Kokkan, was first detected in the Philippines in 1979 and has since been found in India and Sri Lanka. It spreads rapidly, causing significant economic losses, and affects all banana varieties. Severe infections can lead to reduced bunch weights and fruit rejection due to malformed bunches and underdeveloped fingers.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Dark reddish-brown mosaic patterns on flower bracts</li>
                <li>Green or red streaks, spindle-shaped lesions on leaf petioles and midribs of new leaves</li>
                <li>Reddish-brown spindle-like streaks on the stem, visible when dead outer leaves are removed</li>
                <li>Chlorotic streaks on bunch stems and fingers, potentially leading to fruit rejection in severe cases</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>How is it spread?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread by aphids, which acquire the virus while feeding on infected plants</li>
                <li>Transfer through planting material, including tissue culture from infected plants</li>
                <li>Not spread through cutting tools, equipment, or soil</li>
                <li>Rigorous testing of planting material is essential as BBrMV can be detected in symptomless plants</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Where is it found?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>BBrMV has been reported in the Philippines, India, and Sri Lanka</li>
                <li>There are additional reports from Western Samoa and Vietnam, although further investigation is needed to confirm its presence</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Prevention and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Clean Planting Material:</strong> Ensure that all planting material, especially tissue cultures, is certified pest-free. Avoid using materials from unknown or unverified sources.</li>

                <li><strong>Aphid Control:</strong> Since BBrMV is transmitted by aphids, controlling aphid populations is crucial. This can be done using biological controls such as predatory insects, or applying approved insecticides that are safe for use on banana plants.</li>

                <li><strong>Farm Hygiene Practices:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regularly clean and sanitize farm tools and equipment, even though BBrMV is not known to spread through tools. This reduces the risk of spreading other pathogens.</li>
                        <li>Remove infected plant material immediately to prevent the virus from spreading to healthy plants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Quarantine Measures:</strong> Implement strict quarantine protocols when introducing new plants into your farm. Isolate new plants for a period and test them for the virus to ensure they are free of infection.</li>

                <li><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regularly inspect crops for any symptoms of BBrMV. Early detection is key to controlling the spread of the virus.</li>
                        <li>If infected plants are found, promptly remove and destroy them to reduce further contamination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</strong> Adopt an IPM approach that combines biological control agents, cultural practices, and minimal use of chemical insecticides to manage aphid populations and minimize the spread of the virus.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>How can I protect my farm?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use only pest-free, tissue-culture planting material</li>
                <li>Frequently inspect your farm for new pests or unusual symptoms</li>
                <li>Familiarize yourself with common banana pests</li>
            </ul>
