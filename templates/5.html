            <h1>Banana Panama Disease (Fusarium Wilt)</h1>

            <br>
            <h2>What is Panama Disease?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Panama disease, also known as Fusarium wilt, is caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i>.</li>
                <li>The disease affects bananas and is considered one of the most destructive banana diseases worldwide.</li>
                <li>There are four races of the fungus, with Race 4 (Tropical and Subtropical) being the most serious threat to the banana industry, especially for Cavendish bananas.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>What Are the Symptoms?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>External Symptoms:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yellowing of leaf margins on older leaves, followed by browning and collapse, forming a skirt of dead leaves around the plant base.</li>
                        <li>The heart leaves may remain upright, giving a spiky appearance to the plant.</li>
                        <li>As the disease progresses, the plant may appear wilted, and the pseudostem may split.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Internal Symptoms:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discoloration of the vascular tissue in the corm and pseudostem, appearing as reddish-brown or black streaks or rings.</li>
                        <li>Infected plants rarely produce marketable bunches of bananas.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>What Can Panama Disease Be Confused With?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In its early stages, Panama disease can be mistaken for nutritional deficiencies or water stress.</li>
                <li>It can also be confused with bacterial wilts like Moko or blood disease, but these diseases produce bacterial ooze and affect fruit, unlike Panama disease.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>How Is Panama Disease Spread?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread occurs through infected planting material, root-to-root contact, or contaminated soil, water, and tools.</li>
                <li>The fungus can persist in the soil for many years, making it difficult to eliminate once established.</li>
                <li>Movement of soil on vehicles, machinery, or shoes can also spread the disease.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Where Is Panama Disease Found?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Panama disease Race 1 and Race 2 are under quarantine in banana-producing areas of Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia.</li>
                <li>Race 4 (both Tropical and Subtropical strains) is under strict quarantine management in the Northern Territory and parts of Queensland.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Prevention and Control Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exclusion and Quarantine:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use only clean, certified planting material, such as tissue-cultured plants.</li>
                        <li>Avoid introducing infected soil or plant material to healthy areas, and follow strict quarantine regulations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Farm Hygiene:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disinfect machinery, equipment, and footwear before entering and leaving banana farms to prevent the spread of contaminated soil.</li>
                        <li>Avoid sharing farm tools or machinery between farms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Early Detection and Reporting:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regularly inspect crops for symptoms of Panama disease and report any signs immediately.</li>
                        <li>Do not attempt to remove or destroy affected plants yourself, as this can spread the disease further.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Destruction of Infected Plants:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Affected plants should be destroyed in situ using methods such as herbicide injection to minimize disturbance of infected soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>How to Protect Your Farm from Panama Disease?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure only pest-free planting material is used on your farm.</li>
                <li>Maintain strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of infected soil or plant material.</li>
                <li>Wash and disinfect all machinery, equipment, and vehicles before entering the farm.</li>
            </ul>
