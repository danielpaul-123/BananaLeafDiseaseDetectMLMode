            <h1>Banana Insect Pest Diseases</h1>

            <br>
            <h2>Borers: Rhizome Weevil (<i>Cosmopolites sordidus</i>)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symptoms of Damage:</strong> Grubs bore into the rhizome, leading to plant death. Dark tunnels appear in the rhizomes, causing withering of outer leaves and death of unopened pipes.</li>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Eggs are white, laid on the upper part of the rhizome. Grubs are yellowish-white with red heads, while adults are dark brown to black weevils.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use healthy, pest-free suckers for planting.</li>
                        <li>Trim the rhizome and maintain clean cultivation practices.</li>
                        <li>Remove pseudo stems below ground level and avoid susceptible varieties like Robusta and Karpooruvally.</li>
                        <li>Employ traps such as cosmolure or banana corm split traps to capture adult weevils.</li>
                        <li>Apply insecticides like carbofuran or phorate at the time of planting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Pseudostem Borer (<i>Odoiporus longicollis</i>)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symptoms of Damage:</strong> Grubs bore into the pseudostem, creating tunnels, which result in wilting and decomposition. Exudation of plant sap and blackened mass coming out from bore holes are early signs.</li>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Eggs are yellowish-white, cylindrical, and laid randomly on the cut ends of pseudostem. Grubs are creamy white with dark heads, and adults are robust weevils.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prune side suckers and remove dried leaves regularly.</li>
                        <li>Destroy infested plants by uprooting and burning.</li>
                        <li>Set pseudostem traps to reduce adult populations.</li>
                        <li>Apply dimethoate or other recommended insecticides for severe infestations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Sap Feeders: Banana Aphid (<i>Pentalonia nigronervosa</i>)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symptoms of Damage:</strong> Aphids cause stunted growth and bunchy top disease, with leaves forming a rosette-like appearance. Infestation prevents bunch production.</li>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Nymphs are dark-colored, and adults have brownish bodies with black-veined wings.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintain clean cultivation and use pest-free suckers.</li>
                        <li>Destroy diseased plants along with the rhizome to control spread.</li>
                        <li>Encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles and lacewings.</li>
                        <li>Use biocontrol agents like <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> to manage aphid populations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>Leaf Feeders: Castor Hairy Caterpillar (<i>Pericallia ricini</i>)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symptoms of Damage:</strong> Caterpillars scrape chlorophyll from leaves, leading to windowing, which affects unfurled leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Larvae are black with brown heads and long hairs, while adults are grey-colored moths with dark spots on their pinkish wings.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collect and destroy egg masses and caterpillars manually.</li>
                        <li>Use light traps to capture adult moths.</li>
                        <li>Spray insecticides like chlorpyrifos or quinalphos for severe infestations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h2>General Prevention and Management Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean Cultivation:</strong> Ensure regular removal of dried and infested plant materials to minimize pest harboring areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest-Free Planting Material:</strong> Always use certified pest-free planting materials, such as tissue cultures or healthy suckers.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Predators:</strong> Promote natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitoid wasps to manage pest populations organically.</li>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid replanting banana in the same field consecutively to reduce soil-borne pests.</li>
            </ul>
