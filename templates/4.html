            <h1>Moko Disease Fact Sheet</h1>

            <br>
            <h2>What is Moko?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Moko is a severe bacterial disease caused by <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> race 2, which also causes bugtok of banana and is closely related to the bacterium responsible for blood disease.</li>
                <li>Moko is a major cause of banana crop losses, particularly in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Philippines, where it can reduce yields by up to 70% in some areas.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br>
            <h2>What are the Symptoms?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf symptoms:</strong> Yellowing and wilting of leaves, with younger leaves developing pale green or whitish patches before dying. Suckers may also wilt.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem symptoms:</strong> Internal discoloration of the stem, starting as cream or yellow and progressing to brown or black. Bacterial ooze is often present when the stem is cut.</li>
                <li><strong>Fruit symptoms:</strong> Premature ripening of some fingers in otherwise green bunches, internal discoloration (yellow, then brown or grey), and firm rot of the fruit.</li>
                <li>Infected flower buds and peduncles may become blackened and shriveled.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br>
            <h2>What can Moko be confused with?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Moko is often mistaken for blood disease, bugtok, or Panama disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Key differences:</strong> Panama disease does not cause internal fruit discoloration, bacterial ooze, or premature ripening, while bugtok does not cause wilting of the entire plant.</li>
                <li>Laboratory testing is required to distinguish between Moko, blood disease, and other diseases.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br>
            <h2>How is Moko Spread?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Moko bacteria can spread via infected plant parts, including roots, stems, suckers, and fruit. Root-to-root infection can also occur.</li>
                <li>The bacteria can persist in the soil for over 18 months, spreading through contaminated tools, machinery, shoes, hands, and even water run-off.</li>
                <li>Insects can spread Moko from infected male buds to other flowers, and infected fruit shipments are another potential source of infection.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br>
            <h2>Where is Moko Found?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Moko is endemic to Central and South America, the Caribbean, Jamaica, the Philippines, and Guam.</li>
                <li>It was detected in Cairns, Australia in 1989 on imported heliconia plants, but the outbreak was successfully eradicated.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br>
            <h2>Prevention and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pest-Free Planting Material:</strong> Always use certified pest-free planting material, including tissue-cultured plants, to avoid introducing Moko into new areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Farm Hygiene:</strong> Implement strict farm hygiene practices by regularly sanitizing tools, machinery, and equipment. Avoid the movement of soil or plant material between infected and healthy areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection:</strong> Frequently inspect crops for unusual symptoms, especially yellowing or wilting leaves, and report any cases of bacterial ooze or sudden plant death.</li>
                <li><strong>Removal of Infected Plants:</strong> Promptly uproot and destroy infected plants, including their rhizomes and roots, to prevent the bacteria from spreading to nearby plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Insect Control:</strong> Control insects that can spread Moko by using traps, insecticides, and biological control agents such as beneficial predators or parasites.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Management:</strong> Avoid replanting banana crops in infected soils for at least 18 months to prevent the spread of the bacteria.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br>
            <h2>How to Protect Your Farm?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use only pest-free planting material and regularly monitor your farm for any unusual symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
